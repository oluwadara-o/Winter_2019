This code is optimized for larger screens. 
If you are running it on a slightly smaller screens you may only be able to see mars occasionally or not at all
You may set bigscreen = false if you want to see all the planets or click small screen.
Clicking either bigscreen or small screen recenteres the planet
If you do this you will see an approximation with incorrect periodicity, no moon or timer.
